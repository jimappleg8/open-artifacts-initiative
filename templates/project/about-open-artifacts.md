{% pageHeader "What is an Open Artifacts Project?", "Open Artifacts takes the spirit of open-source software and applies it to the rest of the world. You are currently looking at an <b>Open Artifacts Project</b>. This means this website is more than just a static page—it is a collaborative space where people can contribute to ideas that make life better." %}

## The Big Idea

While "Open Source" usually refers to computer code, an **Artifact** is anything humans design. It can be something you hold, like a machine or a piece of pottery, or something intangible, like a cultural tradition, a lesson plan, or a government policy.

An **Open Artifact** is the shared digital blueprint of that thing—accessible, free to use, and ready to be improved by anyone.

## Your Role: The Cultural Creator

We call the people who contribute to these projects **Cultural Creators**. You don't need to be a professional to participate. Whether you are a hobbyist, an expert, or just curious, you play a crucial role. By sharing your insights and creative practice, you help these ideas evolve and improve communities around the globe.
