# About This Project

This is the start of a website dedicated to listing open artifacts projects. The idea is to make them easier to find, so you can contribute to them and grow the whole world-creator ecosystem. It has a sibling at [https://www.openartifacts.org](https://www.openartifacts.org/), the home of the Open Artifacts Initiative.

This is a static website built with Jekyll, but I want to build a web app that will be fully searchable and can process special project files like help wanted lists. If you’re interested in helping develop this web app let me know.

# What is an open artifact?

An artifact is any kind of human-designed tool, technique or technology. Most of what we know about ancient civilizations comes from studying the artifacts they left behind. Our modern world is filled with the artifacts of our time, from buildings and technologies to our laws, governments, art and music.

In our competitive society, the ideas and principles behind many of our most important artifacts are kept hidden from the general public in the name of “intellectual property.” In direct opposition to this trend, an open artifact (OA) is an artifact that is shared with all humanity in the interest of cooperation. To borrow the phrase from the open source software (OSS) movement, it’s an artifact that is free in the sense of free speech, not free beer. The open artifacts movement is an extension of the Open Source software development model. It’s an attempt to apply the concept of open collaboration beyond the computer industry and into all systems related to human survival and the survival of the planet.

While the current systems we use to survive on the planet have brought unparalleled success to many people, they still don’t take care of everyone, nor do they work within the Earth’s systems well enough to be sustainable. Open artifacts are a way for all of us to collaboratively improve how we operate the world. The goal is to move humanity in the direction of life-sustaining world systems that will allow us to survive and thrive far into the future.

## The open artifacts concept

The open artifacts concept comes out of a desire to find a way to help individuals and small groups of people work together toward making the world work for all humanity. There are many kinds of people in the world with many different skills and experiences, and while each of them may have the desire to help, they don’t all have the time, resources, or vision to make something happen by themselves. Open artifacts are intended to bring together people with similar goals so that as a group, they can combine their skills and efforts to create something better than they could have done individually.

Open source software has proven to be very successful in creating world-class software. The idea is simply that projects are organized and made available online for anyone to use. Anyone can also contribute to the project as well—making improvements, pointing out errors, or supplying any other needed work.

## Goals of an open artifacts project

An OT3 project is intended to do several things.

- It sets up an idea or a design so that it can undergo continuous improvement. A “finished design” is simply the latest working version, and the open artifacts team should always be looking for ways to improve it.
    
- It makes it possible for multiple people, from anywhere in the world, to contribute to the project.
    
- It makes the design available to the general population, helping to match a solution with the people who need it.
    

Ideally, an open artifacts project should be designed in a way that it can be modified according to local needs. Complex designs are rarely one-size-fits-all, so an open artifact should be designed with adaptation to local conditions in mind. That might mean designing a series of artifacts that operate under different conditions, or it might mean presenting the information in a form that lets each group create a unique design for their needs.

## Types of open artifacts projects

At its most basic, an open artifacts project is an organized effort to develop a high quality tool, technique or technology that helps solve a problem, and to make it freely available to the public. The visible result of a project is some kind of usable object or artifact.

An artifact can be almost anything. For example, it might be a machine, a book or instruction booklet, proposed legislation, a lesson plan, a game, a website, a computer program, or an organization. The artifact is made freely available in electronic form such that it can either be built from the available information or used directly.

A project should have a stated purpose or goal such as “to design a high-efficiency adobe house.” The project members would work toward that goal and make their work available to others in a form that can be used to build the house. In this case, it might take the form of complete building plans, material lists, and detailed instructions, all made available for download online.

## Getting started

Whether you’re looking for a way to contribute your knowledge to a project or you want to build an existing project and make it available to your community, this site is intended to help you find what you need.

## Open Artifacts Pattern (early version)

Institutions like NGOs and charities aren’t designed to use the best ideas and skills of individuals unless they’re a formal part of the organization. The energy and ideas of skilled people who want to contribute part-time is lost because we don’t know how to harness it.

Therefore:
Create and participate in open artifacts projects so you can collaborate with others across time and space.

it’s important to find people who live near you to work with—[[Local Commonships]]—but you may not be able to find enough expertise to take on some of the problems that need solving. As the old saying goes, we want to act locally, but in order to think globally, we may need a global community of thinkers. That’s where [[Commonships of the Future]] and this pattern come in.

Collaborating across time and distance is tricky thing, yet that is exactly what we need to be able to do. If someone in the U.S. is collaborating with someone in Kenya, the different timezones make it difficult to do it directly. In addition, people who are contributing need to have flexibility; if they’re working during the day, for example, they may need to make their contributions in the late hours after their kids are in bed or they get home from the club.
  
Fortunately, we have a model for long-term collaboration over time and space: the open source software movement. The open source software movement has revolutionized how software is created, shared and sold. The same thing is needed for artifacts that are not software. We should be generating all kinds of open projects to harness the power of minds all over the world toward solutions, and to share those solutions around the world.
  
An open artifacts project is a way to do distributed design. An artifact is designed in a shared space with full transparency. Multiple contributors can add new ideas and make changes asynchronously. By creating a community around a particular problem, we can distribute our cognition, we can create a larger network of thinking.
  
The open source software community has developed software tools that make asynchronous collaboration easier: version control systems allow multiple people to make changes in their own time, then commit those changes to the project without concern that their changes will interfere with those of another contributor. Any conflicts (i.e. two people making different changes to the same part of the project) are detected and can easily be resolved.
  
Open Source Software is aided by the fact that software is digital and therefore easily transferred around the world to anyone with a computer. Software is also written using plain text, which makes it more cross-platform compatible and less likely to be made obsolete by proprietary software changes.
  
With those considerations in mind, we can create similar kinds of projects that can have nothing to do with software. The ability to digitize information through scanning, computer-aided design (CAD) tools, text editors and the like makes it possible to share ideas and solutions across the world. Since they are separate and more generalized from open source software, and “source code” is part of the software model, I call these kinds of projects Open Artifacts projects.
  
Open artifacts can include any project that is free (in the sense of free speech, not free beer, as the software folks like to say), and there are a lot of different groups creating them under a bunch of different names: open data, open science, open education, open source appropriate technology, and websites that allow for sharing work among Makers, like Thingiverse, Instructibles, and more.
  
Different projects have different amounts of openness. There is a grid that is published by SPARC that tries to detail the many ways that openness can be limited. It’s a complicated situation involving whether the resource can be read free of charge and if so, after how much time, whether the resource can be reused, remixed and shared with others, what copyrights and other rights are retained for the work, and more. For this kind of project, I think the most important things are:
  
- that individuals have the ability to contribute to the project. It’s great if something like a textbook is made freely available, but there should be a way to send feedback that can be integrated into future editions.
- that a project can be forked, to use the language of version control software. That means that if you want to start with an existing project but take it in a different direction, you’re free to do so. In terms of licenses, that is the ability to reuse and remix a project.

Open artifacts projects can be designed to be flexible. A solution that works in one part of the world, with a specific culture, climate, educational system and so on, may not work very well in another part of the world where those things are different. Like an open software project, open artifacts can be forked and changed for local conditions. In addition, they could be designed with flexibility built in. For example, instead of defining exactly how a community garden should be arranged, a pattern language could be provided that allows to the local community to design the garden together themselves.
  
The goal of an open artifacts project is to facilitate and document the design process, making it possible for people from all over the world to contribute to a single goal, for the benefit of everyone.
  
An open artifacts project would usually take the form of a website with an associated “repository” storing the project files in a “version control system” like Git. To contribute, project members could pull down a copy of all the files, make changes and then merge their changes back into the main repository when they’re ready.
  
On the website (the files for which could also be in the Git repository) would a way to introduce your project to new contributors and possible users. As such, it might contain a Q&amp;A page that will get them oriented and possibly a discussion board (or social media group page) to make it easier for members to communicate about ideas and questions.
  
In terms of files, create documents for your open artifacts project containing these kinds of artifacts: a digital version of the [[Atlas/Notes/Preferred State]], a list of organizations working on similar problems (these are potential collaborators for your project. They also ensure you’ve researched whether anyone else is already doing what you’re doing), research on existing solutions to the problem you’re trying to solve, proposed solutions that may or may not be explored, and educational materials to help new project members get up to speed.
  
Of course, in addition to all the support documents, you would have the main project files; in essence the artifact—artifacts (48)—that you’re creating. It might take the form of a book, or building plans, or even a business plan. It might be simple or very complex depending on what is needed.

Open artifacts projects can support work being done in all three movements, helping people make a shift in consciousness—[[Atlas/Notes/Collective Actualization]]—through books, workbooks, seminar designs, and more; helping design revolutionaries—[[Atlas/Notes/Design Revolution]]—through defining inventions, writing policy, and more; and helping the [[Atlas/Notes/Global Regeneration]] though defining how to build ecosystems, gathering data for holding actions, coordinating action across long distances to create wildlife corridors, and more. Use the open artifacts project to facilitate and document the [[Atlas/Patterns/Design]] process, including your [[Atlas/Notes/Preferred State]], analysis of [[Atlas/Notes/Past Forces]], your reasoning about what warrants your [[Atlas/Notes/Proactive Urgency]], and the results of the [[Atlas/Notes/Start With Universe]] exercises. In terms of existing projects, participate in [[Local Commonships]] as a way of implementing an open artifacts project in your local community. By creating a local instance of the project, you’ll find ways it can be improved or ways that it needs to be adapted for your local conditions. Make sure you contribute what you learn back to the project

RBF talked about Emergence from Emergency and I think it's important to point out that these open artifacts are preparation for a time when they are needed. If we don't have them ready to go, then the opportunity will be missed.

## What qualifies as an open artifacts project?

- **What types of "source" materials can qualify as open artifacts?**  Are we only talking about code and digital files, or does this extend to physical blueprints, designs, instructional materials, or any other artifacts?
	- Source files can literally be anything, including physical objects and documents but ideally there would be digitized versions of these. If it's an object, I would like to see digital plans or instructions on how to build it, even if that's a video. If you have to, for example, have paper plans sent to you, then I'm not sure it qualifies. It seems too closed for there to be an effective feedback loop. 
    
- **What constitutes "freely available"?**  
    Does the project need to provide these materials without restrictions (e.g., paywalls, account sign-ups), or are certain barriers acceptable?
    
- **Does the licensing matter?**  
    Should the project explicitly use open licenses (e.g., Creative Commons, GNU GPL, MIT), or is implicit sharing without a clear license sufficient?
    
- **What does "anyone is able to contribute" entail?**  
    Is it enough for the project to have a public feedback mechanism (e.g., forums, GitHub issues), or does it need to allow for direct contributions like edits or pull requests?
    
- **What level of openness in contribution is required?**  
    Must the contributions be entirely unrestricted, or are moderation, approval processes, or gatekeeping acceptable as long as the system is open to all?
    
- **Does the organization behind the project need to be non-commercial?**  
    Can commercial organizations or projects qualify as long as the source and contributions meet the criteria?
    
- **How critical is the sustainability of the project?**  
    Should the project have ongoing activity and support, or can dormant projects also qualify as open artifacts?
    
- **What kind of documentation or transparency is required?**  
    Does the project need to provide thorough explanations of how to use or replicate the artifacts, or is the mere availability of materials enough?
    
- **Does the project need to foster a community?**  
    Is active participation or collaboration by a community a requirement, or can a project qualify even if there’s little community interaction?
    
- **What impact does platform choice have?**  
    Does the platform where the materials and contributions are hosted (e.g., GitHub, custom websites, forums) affect whether it qualifies as an open artifacts project?
    
- **Do ethical considerations play a role?**  
    Should projects promoting harmful or unethical practices be excluded, even if they meet the openness criteria?
    
- **Does the project need to explicitly label itself as open?**  
    Can projects that function as open artifacts without self-identifying as such still qualify?
