# About This Project

The Open Artifacts Initiative is an open artifacts project designed to support the creation and continuance of other open artifacts projects.

Our first priority is to educate cultual creators like you about open artifacts. We have a formal [Open Artifacts Definition](project/open-artifacts-definition/) and information about some of the [best licenses for open artifacts](/project/open-artifacts-licenses/).

Future goals are to support the creation of a self-funded GitLab service that can be used to host your open artifacts projects at no cost.

We're also interested in providing a form of succession for open artifacts projects. If and when a project maintainer is no longer able to maintain a project, they should be able to transfer it to the OA Initiative. We will ensure that it stays available and look for a new maintainer so the project doesn't disappear.

If you are interested in the potential of open artifacts, we hope you'll join with us and work toward these goals.
