## Welcome to the Open Artifacts Initiative

The Open Artifacts Initiative is an informal organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the creation of Open Artifact projects.

Open Artifact projects are similar to open source software projects except they're not limited to software.


## Why a different organization?

The open artifacts initiative is intended to promote and encourage open projects that are specifically designed to make the world a better place. The name comes from Buckminster Fuller, who referred to his inventions, books, and other physical "special case" manifestations of his ideas as "artifacts."
